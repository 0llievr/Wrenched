# Wrenched - A cycling companion app

Wrenched was born out of a necessity for something better. Before its creation, maintenance records where things only bike shop mechanics would keep. Because of this, many cyclists have a hard time remembering just how long it has been since they did a full service, chain replacement or even when they last washed and lube their bike. Other cycling apps try to help dolve this by letting users know how many total miles are on their bike. This is great information to have but it does not paint a full picture, leading cyclists to get creative to further solve the issue. The most common thing to do is have a little notebook and write down all the work that you have done. This was the ideological foundation that wrenched was built upon. Wrenched is a cycling companion app that helps riders better take care of their bicycle though the use of data rich service logs.
